  "introduction": "My coding journey spans across a wide spectrum of skills, from frontend to backend, and even into the realm of DevOps. On the frontend side, I've delved deep into popular frameworks such as Angular, Vue, React, and Svelte, mastering tools like NgRx, Vuex, and React-redux for state management. I've also honed my skills in UI/UX design with libraries like AngularMaterial, ReactMaterialUI, and Boostrap, and brought dynamic animations to life with Angular Animation, React-transition-group, and Motion one. \n\nMy expertise extends to the world of web extensions, where I've worked with ManifestV3, Content script, and Background script, and into the fascinating world of micro-frontends, web components and shell architecture.\n\nWhile specialised in frontend, I've embraced a variety of backend technologies, from Java-based Spring frameworks like SpringBoot to TypeScript-powered NestJs. I have experience in building microservices, handling SQL and RESTful APIs, and even diving into DevOps practices. \n\nWith proficiency in tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitLab and Github Action, I've leveraged my skills to deploy applications efficiently, all while maintaining code quality through Eslint, Stylelint, and Sonarlint."
