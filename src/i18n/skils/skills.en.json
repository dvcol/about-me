  "introduction": "My coding journey has taken me across a broad range of areas, from backend and DevOps to web design. However, my true passion and expertise lie in frontend development, where Iâ€™ve had the chance to truly refine my skills.\n\nWith hands-on experience in multiple frameworks (Vue, Svelte, React, Angular, Solid, etc.) and various architectures (microservices, micro-frontends, web extensions, etc.), I love building web applications and crafting user experiences, no matter the scale or complexity."
