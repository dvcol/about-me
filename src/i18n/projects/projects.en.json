  "introduction": "Passionate about technology, I'm always eager to explore new frameworks, tools, and libraries to stay at the forefront of web development. Whether it’s testing out the latest frontend innovations or refining my skills, I love experimenting and learning new things.\n\nWith experience in Vue, Svelte, and React, I’ve built a collection of small open-source applications, which are freely accessible on GitHub or as live web demos. I enjoy creating projects that not only showcase technical skills but also solve real problems or explore interesting concepts.\n\nBeyond development, I have a strong interest in web design. I’m always drawn to the latest design trends, whether they lead to polished, innovative interfaces or just fun experiments. Finding the balance between aesthetics and usability is something I’m constantly striving for."
