  "title": "About Me",
  "introduction": "In 2015, I earned a Master's degree in Theoretical Economics, followed by a Master's in Data Science in 2016. Following my graduation, I worked as a Research Assistant at Hospinomics in 2016, gaining valuable research experience in scripting and data analysis.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, I embarked on a six-year web development journey, beginning in 2017 as a Fullstack Developer at Sopra Steria. In this role, I actively contributed to agile development projects, seamlessly working on both frontend and backend microservices, with a specialization in Angular and Java technologies.\n\nIn 2021, I joined Ippon Technologies as a Fullstack contractor, and quickly assumed the role of a Frontend Engineer at ContentSquare. There, I became an essential member of the core application team, focusing primarily on frontend development and ci/cd. My journey at ContentSquare allowed me to refine my frontend skills and deepen my expertise in modern web technologies."
